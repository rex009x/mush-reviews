## 🔪 Instructions

### 1. Season the Chicken

1. Pat the chicken thigh dry like a responsible adult.
2. Mix garlic powder, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.
3. Drizzle olive oil over the chicken and rub the seasoning all over it.
4. If you have 5 minutes, let it sit—if not, the air fryer forgives you.

### 2. Air Fry

1. Preheat your air fryer to **380°F (193°C)**.
2. Place the chicken thigh in the basket (no need for foil—let the air do its thing).
3. Air fry for **12–15 minutes**, flipping halfway.
4. Check that it hits **165°F (74°C)** internally.
5. Let it rest for a couple minutes so the juices redistribute and the chicken feels appreciated.

### 3. Cook the Pasta

1. Bring salted water to a boil.
2. Add pasta and cook according to the box.
3. Drain but don’t rinse—team starch forever.

### 4. Warm the Marinara

1. Heat marinara in a small pot until warm and cozy.
2. Give it a stir so it doesn’t splatter like a tiny tomato volcano.

### 5. Assemble

- Slice your air-fried chicken.
- Add pasta to a bowl.
- Ladle marinara on top.
- Crown it with the chicken slices.
- Parmesan if you want to feel fancy.
